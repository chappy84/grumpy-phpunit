# Acknowledgements
Books don't happen without lots of help from other people. That said, I wish
to thank the following people:

* Kim Rowan for her editing efforts
* Chris Tankersley and Matthew Weier O'Phinney for their technical editing
* Members of 30x500 for conversations about marketing and selling things to developers
* My PHP Testing Bootcamp course students, for reminding me about what I take for granted
* conference organizers who have graciously allowed me to promote my ideas on testing and application building

Finally, none of this would be possible without the incredibly high
tolerance level of my wife, Claire.  Owner of the best Twitter handle
ever in @internet\_widow, she has learned over the years when it
is best to just nod and smile when I start going on and on about
something I am passionate about.
