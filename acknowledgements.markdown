# Acknowledgements
Books don't happen without lots of help from other people. That said, I wish
to thank the following people:

* Sebastian Bergman and all the contributers to the PHPUnit project for providing a powerful tool for unit testing code
* Kim Rowan for her editing efforts
* Chris Tankersley and Matthew Weier O'Phinney for their technical editing
* Members of 30x500 for conversations about marketing and selling things to developers
* My PHP Testing Bootcamp course students, for reminding me about what I take for granted
* conference organizers who have graciously allowed me to promote my ideas on testing and application building
* Tanya Lam (http://www.tanyalam.com/) for the awesome cover art

Finally, none of this would be possible without the incredibly high
tolerance levels of my wife, Claire. She handles my frequent absences (both
real and virtual) with grace and humour.
