# Acknowledgements
Books don't happen without lots of help from other people. That said, I wish
to thank the following people:

* Sebastian Bergman and all the contributers to the PHPUnit project for providing a powerful tool for testing PHP code
* Kim Rowan for her editing efforts
* Chris Tankersley and Matthew Weier O'Phinney, for their technical editing
* Members of Amy Hoy's 30x500 course for conversations about marketing and selling things to developers
* My PHP Testing Bootcamp students for reminding me about what I take for granted
* conference organizers who have graciously allowed me to promote my ideas on testing and application building
* Tanya Lam (http://www.tanyalam.com/) for the awesome cover art

A special thanks must go out to people who take the time to discuss issues
involved with testing software applications with me. Your questions and thoughts
inspire me to keep sharing the things I learn.

Finally, none of this would be possible without the incredibly high
tolerance levels of my wife, Claire. She handles my frequent absences (both
real and virtual) with grace and humour.
