# Introduction
When I wrote my book "The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable Applications In PHP" 
my goal was to teach people how to write code that
you could easily test. My reasoning was that there was lots of information
available on how to use testing tools.

Turns out I was only partially right.

While a good search using your search engine of choice can show you how to
accomplish certain tasks, it was difficult to find one place that showed
anything beyond extremely shallow solutions.

I did some more research. I signed up for an awesome product development
course that taught me how to do even more research, and I started creating
a solution that I was certain would help people solve the pain of how to
actually write tests for their PHP code using PHPUnit.

The result is this book. I've tried to give you examples of code that we
are trying to write tests for, along with explanations about the decisions
that I've made. 

Don't think of this book as something that you will read
end-to-end. It's far more likely that you will end up using it a chapter
at a time, learning the skills to give you a solid understanding of just
one part of the testing process.

As always, I welcome your feedback via Twitter (@grmpyprogrammer) or via
